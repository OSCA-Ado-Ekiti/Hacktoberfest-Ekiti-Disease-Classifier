## Disease Classifier

Analyze the data and build a machine learning model capable of diagnosing common diseaes among students. 

Complete Dataset consists of 2 CSV files. One of them is training and other is for testing your model. Each CSV file has 133 columns. 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and last column is the prognosis. These symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases you can classify these set of symptoms to. You are required to train your model on training data and test it on testing data.
  
Source data from: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning)

Select or create an issue you want to work on and it will be assigned to you. If you want to create an entire different solution approach, you can create a new notebook from scratch

P.S: contribution to this repo is strictly by quality code
